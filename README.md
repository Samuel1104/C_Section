# C_Section
Practice Sessions
I'm trying to learn the C Programming language.
This repo will contain codes from my personal practice.
I am currently learning through the book Head First C. I may add other resources as time goes on.
I am also currently enrolled in the ALX softwware engineeering program.
They teach C. It's part of their curriculum.
However, the practice from the program are saved in other repos.
I have created this repo to keep track of my personal development in this journey of learning the C programming language.
Thank you.
